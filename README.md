  A collection of small utilities and complementary Lodash add-ons.
</p>

---

## Install

```bash
npm i tings
# or
yarn add tings
```

> Rather than reinvent the wheel, some of these utilities depend on Lodash
> functions. This way, you will know that the two libraries are compatible. For
> example, `isCamelCase` will return true for any string converted using
> Lodash's `camelCase` function.

> The functions are marked below if they require Lodash, and you will need to
> install Lodash if you would like to use that function.
